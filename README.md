# Student-Roster-App
Maintains a current roster of students within a given course.  Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree.  The program reads a list of five students and uses function calls to manipulate data.  While parsing the list of data, the program creates student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program.  The entire student list is stored in one array of students called  classRosterArray.  Specific data-related output is directed to the console.
